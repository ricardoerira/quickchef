            <p class="mt-4">CookScan ("us", "we", or "our") operates the CookScan mobile application (the "Service" or "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our iOS App. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.</p>

            <h2>1. Collection of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>

            <h3>Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>
            <p>We collect personally identifiable information, such as your email address, name, and photographs of ingredients, that you voluntarily give to us when you register with the App (if applicable) or when you choose to participate in various activities related to the App, such as uploading photos for recipe generation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create an account, we may collect your name, email address, and password. The purpose of collecting this information is to create and manage your account, provide you with access to certain features, and communicate with you.</li>
                <li><strong>Ingredient Photographs:</strong> When you use our core feature to generate recipes from photos, you provide us with images of food ingredients. The purpose of collecting these images is solely to analyze them with our AI to identify ingredients and suggest recipes. These images may be temporarily stored to improve our AI model's accuracy but are not used to personally identify you unless linked to your account.</li>
                <li class="placeholder-text"><strong>User Content:</strong> [If users can save recipes, rate them, or add notes, specify that data collection here and its purpose.]</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Collected Automatically</h3>
            <h4>Usage Data</h4>
            <p>Information our servers automatically collect when you access the App, such as your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, your access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the App. If you are using our mobile application, this information may also include your device name and type, your operating system, your phone number (if provided), your country, your likes and replies to a post, and other interactions with the application and other users via server log files, as well as any other information you choose to provide.</p>
            <p>The purpose of collecting Usage Data is to understand how our Service is used, to monitor and improve the App's performance and stability, and for security purposes.</p>

            <h4>Mobile Device Data</h4>
            <p>Device information, such as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer, and information about the location of your device, if you permit us to access this information. The purpose of collecting this information, if enabled, is <span class="placeholder-text">[e.g., to offer location-based recipe suggestions or for analytics to improve service coverage. Be specific.]</span></p>

            <h4>Camera Access</h4>
            <p>Our App requires access to your device's camera to allow you to take photos of ingredients for recipe generation. We only access your camera when you actively use this feature. The images are processed as described under "Ingredient Photographs." We do not access your photo library unless you explicitly grant permission to select photos from it.</p>

            <h3 class="placeholder-text">Data From Third Parties</h3>
            <p class="placeholder-text">[If you integrate with third-party services like social logins or other data sources, detail that here. E.g., "Information from social networks, such as Apple Game Center, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, if you connect your account to such social networks." Be clear about what is collected and why.]</p>

            <h3 class="placeholder-text">Tracking Technologies (Cookies, Beacons, etc.)</h3>
            <p class="placeholder-text">[If you use any form of tracking, including for analytics or advertising, you must be very clear here. Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework requires user consent for tracking across apps and websites owned by other companies.]</p>
            <p class="placeholder-text">We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on the App to help customize the App and improve your experience. When you access the App, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the availability and functionality of the App.</p>
            <p class="placeholder-text"><strong>App Tracking Transparency (ATT):</strong> If we use identifiers for tracking (as defined by Apple), we will request your permission before doing so through Apple's ATT framework. You can manage your tracking preferences in your device settings.</p>

            <h2>2. Use of Your Information</h2>
            <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:</p>

            <h2>3. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:</p>

            <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>
            <p>If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including data analysis, AI model processing (for ingredient recognition), email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.</p>
            <ul class="placeholder-text">
                <li><strong>Cloud Hosting:</strong> [e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure] for storing app data and processing images.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> [e.g., Firebase Analytics, Amplitude] to understand app usage. We will ensure these providers comply with privacy standards and, where applicable, data is anonymized or aggregated.</li>
                <li class="placeholder-text"><strong>AI Service Providers:</strong> [If using a third-party AI API for image analysis, specify it here and link to their privacy policy.]</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We require our third-party service providers to use your personal information only to perform the services we have hired them to provide and to take reasonable measures to protect your personal information.</p>

            <h3 class="placeholder-text">Marketing Communications</h3>
            <p class="placeholder-text">[With your consent, or if permitted by opt-out, we may share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, as permitted by law. Clearly explain opt-in/opt-out mechanisms.]</p>

            <h3 class="placeholder-text">Interactions with Other Users</h3>

            <h3 class="placeholder-text">Business Transfers</h3>
            <p class="placeholder-text">We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Account information is retained as long as your account is active and for a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.</li>
                <li>Ingredient photographs submitted for recipe generation may be retained <span class="placeholder-text">[specify duration, e.g., "for up to X months"]</span> to improve our AI models, after which they are anonymized or deleted. You can request earlier deletion.</li>
                <li>Usage data may be retained in an aggregated or anonymized form for analytical purposes for a longer period.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.</p>

            <h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>

If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
            <p>If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.</p>
